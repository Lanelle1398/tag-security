**Project proposal and Initial questions**

Hi!
I am Saurabh Rajguru and my team of five students from New York University are carrying out a security self-assessment of the [Thanos Project](https://thanos.io/).

This assessment is inline with the CNCF Security Technical Advisory Group's (CNCF Security TAG) security assessment process.
The [self-assessment](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md) is the first step for initiating a joint assessment with the CNCF Security TAG.

This is being done as part of a graduate level course under Justin Cappos, Professor at New York University. Refer [[1]](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/issues/1102)
He is a [Technical Lead](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/governance/roles.md#role-of-technical-leads) and [Security Assessment Facilitator](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/governance/roles.md#facilitation-roles) in CNCF Security TAG.

We need help with reviews and feedback from the maintainers on our draft of the security assessment. PFB the link to our assessment. We will be submitting this assessment to the CNCF TAG repository so that they can help with initiating a joint assessment for Thanos. It would be great if some of you could join an online meeting with us and we can explain what we have done and the expectation.

Questions:
1. The admin api of Prometheus has to enabled for Sidecar to get external labels. Is the admin api only used for fetching labels? Do we need complete admin access or is this only for labels?
